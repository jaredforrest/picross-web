# Picross Web
Currently this is pretty bare-bones but eventually this will be a picross website where users can submit puzzles and play other peoples puzzle. Eventually there will be integrations with [Nonocross](https://github.com/jaredforrest/nonocross).

It's written in vanilla js but that is subject to change.
